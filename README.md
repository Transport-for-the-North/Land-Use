# Land-Use

NorMITs Land Use Tool is a tool that create a current year (2018) residential base population estimates. 
NorMITs Land Use uses the property data built from Ordnance Surveyâ€™s data, synthesised census detail using property attributes which are then adjusted to changes in household properties and occupants that have occurred since the census. 
The outputs serve as a base for residential and non-residential uses within the Travel Market Synthesiser. 
The property type analysis available at this level together with the geographical location of the property provide us with a detailed segmentation of the household.
