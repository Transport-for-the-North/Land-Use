# Land-Use

NorMITs Land Use Tool (NLU) is a tool that create a current year residential base population estimates. NorMITs Land Use uses the property data built from Ordnance Surveyâ€™s data, synthesised census detail using property attributes which are then adjusted to changes in household properties and occupants that have occurred since the census. The tool outputs population details aggregated to a specified zoning system (currently at LSOA and MSOA level) that will serve as a basic input for a wide range of research and planning studies, policy applications and transport model development. The outputs serve as a base for residential and non-residential uses within the Travel Market Synthesiser. The property type analysis available at this level together with the geographical location of the property provide us with a detailed segmentation of the household.
